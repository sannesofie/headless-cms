 * Writing down complex querystrings by hand can be a difficult task.
 * Luckily libraries exist that can help us to generate the right querystring programmatically.
 * One of these libraries is qs, and in the following exercises we will practise using qs to perform 
 * fetch request in order to answer questions about the system.
 * 
 * Throughout these exercises the strapi api endpoint documentation will be useful: 
 * https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest-api.html#api-endpoints
